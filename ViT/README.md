# Visual Transformer

Using the embedding vectors generated by [Prov-GigaPath](https://huggingface.co/prov-gigapath/prov-gigapath/tree/main), a classification model is built using various artificial neural networks.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following dependencies are required:

* **Operating System**: Rocky Linux 8.6 (Green Obsidian) or other compatible Linux distributions
* **Python Version**: 3.8 or higher
* **CUDA Version**: 11.6 (Note: `tileenv` uses a higher version of CUDA than the server, which prevents GPU utilization)
* **Libraries**:

  * PyTorch 1.10 or higher
  * torchvision 0.11.0 or higher
  * numpy 1.21.0 or higher
  * pandas 1.3.3 or higher
  * timm 0.6.12
  * Hugging Face Hub

## Server Environment

The server used for this project is part of the **UNLV DataX Lab**, specifically utilizing the **RebelX JupyterHub**. Job management is handled via **SLURM**, a job scheduler that allows efficient execution and resource allocation across multiple compute nodes.

### Running Jobs

To execute your code, navigate to the **run directory** and use the provided shell scripts (`*.sh`) for job submission. The process typically involves running SLURM-managed jobs as follows:

```bash
# Example of running a job
sbatch run_job.sh
```

This command will submit the job to the SLURM scheduler, which will handle the execution based on available resources.

## Setting up the Environment

### Create the Conda Environment

To get started, you'll need to create a new Conda environment. Follow the steps below:

```bash
# Create a new Conda environment
conda env create -f tileenv.yml
```
